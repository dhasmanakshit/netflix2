we’ll use create react app cmd
>>> npx  create-react-app  ur-desired-name
this cmd uses webpack as bundler instead of parcel
it’ll also have react libs already
package.josn already has some script (which were used as shortcuts for cmds)

in VS code terminal do
>>> npm run start OR npm start
both will just run the cmd that is in 'start' keyword in package.json

we'll use tailwind css
goto to their site > getstarted > framework > create-react-app


if you get some [library: 'digital envelope routines']
try install react-dom
>>> npm install react react-dom

now we can see our app
>>> npm start


what pages will we have:
- Login (before auth)
- browse (after auth)
    - header
        - home
        - movies
        - tv shows
        - my list
        - browse by lang.
    - 1 movie trailer
        - video in background
        - title over video
        - descr
        - play button
    - recommendations
        - various categories sections
            - movies list in caraousel


lets start building comp. in 'components' folder

'rafce' shortcut generates a boilerplate code
react_arraow_function_comp_export
works in JS, JSX file

we'll do routing such that 
"../" will goto login page
"../browser" will goto browser page

>>> npm i -D react-router-dom
then inside Body comp's callback func
const approuter = createBrowserRouter([])

now Body.jsx comp would just return 'RouterProvider' with router value as our approuter
