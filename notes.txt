we’ll use create react app cmd
>>> npx  create-react-app  ur-desired-name
this cmd uses webpack as bundler instead of parcel
it’ll also have react libs already
package.josn already has some script (which were used as shortcuts for cmds)

in VS code terminal do
>>> npm run start OR npm start
both will just run the cmd that is in 'start' keyword in package.json

we'll use tailwind css
goto to their site > getstarted > framework > create-react-app


if you get some [library: 'digital envelope routines']
try install react-dom
>>> npm install react react-dom

now we can see our app
>>> npm start


what pages will we have:
- Login (before auth)
- browse (after auth)
    - header
        - home
        - movies
        - tv shows
        - my list
        - browse by lang.
    - 1 movie trailer
        - video in background
        - title over video
        - descr
        - play button
    - recommendations
        - various categories sections
            - movies list in caraousel


lets start building comp. in 'components' folder

'rafce' shortcut generates a boilerplate code
react_arraow_function_comp_export
works in JS, JSX file

we'll do routing such that 
"../" will goto login page
"../browser" will goto browser page

>>> npm i -D react-router-dom
then inside Body comp's callback func
const approuter = createBrowserRouter([])

now Body.jsx comp would just return 'RouterProvider' with router value as our approuter

const email = useRef(null)  // kinda works as document.getElement()
mention ref={email} on input tag
now 'email' will always have input_html_element reference
now 'email.current.value' will have whatever user entered in that input

! firebase:
goto https://console.firebase.google.com/
create proj
to host our app in firebase server: 
select web-app
do all the steps mentioned to deploy
: fyi (when asked use these answers)
What do you want to use as your public directory? build
Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? N

then do >>> npm run build  // CRA will run some scripts & generate our prod_ready_app in build folder
then >>> firebase deploy  // firebase gives us a live url 

url for this project:
https://netflix2-9f9c5.web.app/

we are using firebase for authentication
for to site select proj, select auth in build menu
add ur logins (email,facebook,google)
add users who can login


----------------

now using firebase lib to sign-up/sign-in users
go thru docs online: firebase > webapp > authentication > password
(youll find sign-in/sig-up function there)

we use getAuth() to execute all firebase API, so we'll put it somewhere in common file 'firebase.js'
we can call getAuth() anywhere in our app, we just choose not to call it again&again

-------
? to deplo CHANGES

npm run build
firebase deploy


--- 
now after signin we'll open browse page
so we'll store authenticated 'user' object in redux 

>>> npm i -D @reduxjs/toolkit
>>> npm i react-redux

then we'll create appStore.js, slice for user redux
& wrap <body> in file_app.js inside <provider>

when to add user in redux? when there is any change in auth_state
firebase gives an Api for that 
we'll copy&paste this api where we are doing the routing (although we can write it anywhere)
::online documentation under firebase > auth > web > managew users

onAuthStateChanged() is like an event-listener
so we wanna exe it only once using using useEffect()
