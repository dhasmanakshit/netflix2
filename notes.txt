weâ€™ll use create react app cmd
>>> npx  create-react-app  ur-desired-name
this cmd uses webpack as bundler instead of parcel
itâ€™ll also have react libs already
package.josn already has some script (which were used as shortcuts for cmds)

in VS code terminal do
>>> npm run start OR npm start
both will just run the cmd that is in 'start' keyword in package.json

we'll use tailwind css
goto to their site > getstarted > framework > create-react-app


if you get some [library: 'digital envelope routines']
try install react-dom
>>> npm install react react-dom

now we can see our app
>>> npm start
